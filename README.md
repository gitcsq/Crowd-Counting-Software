# CrowdCounting-Software
This is the software for Crowd Counting with the main functionalities of recording, alarming, and playbacks. 
Moreover, with the toolbar on the top of the interface, users can also:
1. choose whether to play local videos or start capturing the video stream
2. select the specific neural network model they want to use (inference with default parameters on the server or upload parameters trained by users themselves)
3. set the threshold of people to start alarming
4. see data analysis

Note that the accuracy of the counting process is determined by the model chosen for counting.
